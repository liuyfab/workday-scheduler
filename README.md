Third Party API Challenge

# Summary
1. Added the current date to the top of the planner 
2. Created time blocks for each hour of the work day 
3. Each block is color coded depending on if has already past, is the curent time block, or is a block in the future. 
4. Users can click into a time block to enter text, then click on the save button to revert the textarea back to non-editable text. *
5. Clicking the save button additionally stores the entered item to localStorage.  
6. When the application is opened or refreshed, the events saved to localStorage are loaded into the schedule. 
7. Users can click on an existing item on the schedule and update the text. Clicking on save will update the exiting schedule item both on the schedule and in localStorage. 
8. Users can click on an item to edit and delete all of the text, then click save to delete the item entirely from the application and from localStorage.
